# Review audit logs

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse audit logs record actions that generate a change in Lighthouse or other Microsoft 365 services. Create, edit, delete, assign, and remote actions all create audit events that you can review. By default, auditing is enabled for all customers. It can't be disabled.

## Before you begin

To view audit logs, you must have one of the following permissions:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role - Global Administrator of partner tenant

- Microsoft Partner Center role - Admin Agent

## Review audit logs

1. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select **Audit logs**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take up to 1 hour to see new logs. Go to the respective service to see the most recent changes.

2. Filter the logs, as needed, by using the following options:

    - **Date range** - Previous month, week, or day.
    - **Tenants** - Tenant tags or customer tenant names.
    - **Activity** - Microsoft 365 activity type that corresponds to the action taken. For more information, see the [Activities](#activities) table.
    - **Initiated by** -  Who initiated the action.

3. Select a log from the list to see full details, including the **Request** body.

    To export log data to a comma-separated values (.csv) file, select **Export**.
